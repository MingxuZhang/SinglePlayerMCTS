Single Player Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation.

This is a mostly* game-independent Python implementation of the single player Monte Carlo tree search as described in the paper:
https://dke.maastrichtuniversity.nl/m.winands/documents/CGSameGame.pdf


*I say mostly because the tree search class still requires customized evaluation of the simulation result (ex: win/loss). Planned to be replaced to make the tree search class completely independent in the future.
